# Guidelines:
# Do not change the structure of the file. All fields (red text) should match the example. The only fields
# which can be changed have comments next to them. All values (green text) can be changed. Remember to put a value of
# "None" next to the "Player Head Owner" field if the "Material" field does not have a value of "PLAYER_HEAD". The
# inventory size should be a multiple of 9 that is greater than 0. The inventory will have a width of 9 by default and
# the height will be the inventory size divided by 9. The slot numbers will start from the top left and will go across
# each row. The slot number starts from 0 and ends at the inventory size minus one. The value for the "Lore" field must
# be a list. A list is a group of values with dashes in front of them, as is shown in the example.

Name: Tribe 1 # you can add color codes to the name, but surround the name in quotes if you do so
Material: PLAYER_HEAD
Player Head Owner: 6c9c944b-7771-447b-b332-fbade2f0e235 # set to a player's head because material is of type PLAYER_HEAD
Slot Number: 0 # starts from 0, ends at inventory size - 1
Lore: # must be a list
  - This is the lore of the item which represents tribe 1.
